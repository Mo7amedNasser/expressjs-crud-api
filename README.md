# Express RESTful API CRUD Project

A simple and efficient RESTful API built with Express.js and MongoDB for managing products.  
This project demonstrates the fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a product resource, making it an excellent starting point for learning backend development with Node.js and MongoDB.

## Features

- RESTful API endpoints for managing products  
- CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete  
- **Robust data validation using [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) schema validation library to ensure type safety and data integrity**  
- Comprehensive error handling with meaningful HTTP status codes  
- JSON request and response handling for seamless API interaction  
- Connection to MongoDB Atlas for reliable cloud database storage  

## Technologies Used

- Node.js  
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)  
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) with Mongoose ODM  
- [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for schema validation  
- ES Modules (import/export syntax)

## API Testing

All API endpoints have been thoroughly tested using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).  
You can explore the complete API documentation and test the requests directly through the published Postman documentation here:
